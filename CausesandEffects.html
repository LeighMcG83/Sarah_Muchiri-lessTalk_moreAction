          <h2>How Does Climate Change Affect Our Seas?</h2>
          <p class="lrg-text">  
          Our seas are home to a vast amount of wild species, from tiny littel plankton, to the biggest creature that has ever existed- the blue whale. Did you know that there are more than 260,000 different species living in these seas, and we know that there are way more to be discovered.

          There are various ways Climate Change affects our seas, one of those ways are caused by greenhouse gases. Did you know that greenhouse gases trap energy from the sun, and as they trap that energy, the oceans are absorbing way more heat than there suppost to. This results to an increase in sea temperatures and rising of sea levels. If we continue to let this happen the changes in the oceans temperature and currents will lead to alterations in climate patterns around the world.

              <h2>Carbon Dioxide</h2>
              <p class="info-section-para padding-right-left">
               Another way is corbon dioxide. Too much carbon dioxide affects sea water.There are both natural and human sources of carbon dioxide. Natural sources include decompostation, ocean release and respiration. Human sources come from activities like deforestation, burning of fossil fuels like coal and cement production. When it is too much sea water dissolves carbon dioxide to make corbonic acid which affects marine life. So how exactly does this happen? Let me explain. Our seas are like an incredible carbon sink- they absorb about 25 percent of carbon dioxide produced by humans each year. The result, not so suprising, is that the ocean becomes more acidic. This is really upsetting beacause millions and millions of organisms rely on these oceans, and even us as humans depend on the ocean for food and survival.
